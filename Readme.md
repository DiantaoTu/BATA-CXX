# BATA  --- C++

An implementation of the BATA algorithm in "Baseline Desensitizing In Translation Averaging" - CVPR 2018.

The origin code of BATA is can be found [here](https://bbzh.github.io/).

However, the origin code is written in Matlab, which is difficult to integrate into existing SfM systems. So I rewrite the algorithm in C++ with Eigen. 

## Requirements 

- Eigen >= 3.4.0
